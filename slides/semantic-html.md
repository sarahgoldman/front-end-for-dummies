# Semantic HTML

There are **semantic** and **non-semantic** elements. 

A semantic element clearly **describes its meaning** to both the browser and the developer, and is important for both accessibility as well as SEO.

New semantic HTML5 tags enable better standardization and make it easier for search engines to identify content correctly.

**Non-Semantic:**

div, span, i, b

**Semantic:**

form, header, footer, section, em
