# Semantic HTML

There are **semantic** and **non-semantic** elements. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

New semantic HTML5 tags enable better standardization and make it easier for search engines to identify content correctly.

**Non-Semantic:**

div, span, i, b

**Semantic:**

form, header, footer, section, em
