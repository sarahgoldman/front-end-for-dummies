<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>CSS controls the presentation <br>
of the document. Style rules are <br>
applied to parts of the document by <br>
using selectors and contain a list of <br>
properties and values.</p>

<p>Because a part of the document can <br>
have more than one rule applied to it, <br>
<b>styles are applied in a cascading order</b>.</p>
