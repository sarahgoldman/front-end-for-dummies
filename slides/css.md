<h1>CSS</h1>

<p>CSS controls the presentation of <br>
the document. Style rules select parts <br>
of the document and apply a list of  <br>
properties and values.</p>

<p>Because a part of the document can <br>
have more than one rule applied to it, <br>
<b>styles are applied in cascading order</b>.</p>
