# CSS Best Practices

* **Leverage the cascade order** <br>Write style rules from general to specific. Rely on inheritance.

* **Avoid !important** <br>Related to leveraging the cascade order, `!important` should be be used with care and should usually be avoided. If it's being used often, you probably are not defining styles in the best order.

* **Make it readable** <br>Each property gets its own line. Use correct indentation.
